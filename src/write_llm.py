"""Stage 3b: writing.

Per the plan (kept as-is) plus the review's addition, plus a broadened style
pass (see below):
  1. draft         - LLM writes the Persian item from full article text (or
                      teaser fallback), prompted with both the register guide
                      and the anti-AI-writing guide so most patterns never
                      make it into the first draft at all
  2. mechanical pass - cheap, deterministic character fixes: Arabic ي/ك ->
                      Persian ی/ک, curly quotes -> straight quotes. Also
                      flags (does not fix) formal/literary markers, Persian
                      AI-cliché phrases, and em/en dashes for the LLM pass to
                      handle, since rewriting around any of those requires
                      judgment about what to say instead
  3. style pass    - LLM self-check against BOTH the register checklist and
                      the anti-AI-writing guide, addresses whatever the
                      mechanical pass flagged. This replaces the original
                      register-only self-check: same trigger condition (skip
                      the call when nothing was flagged), broader scope.
  4. fact pass     - LLM self-check: does every specific claim trace back to the
                      source text? This is new vs. the original plan, which only
                      had the source link as an after-the-fact safety net.

draft + style pass are "kept exactly as specified" from the plan's §4 item 4,
just widened from register-only to register+anti-AI. The fact pass is the
review's addition, a genuinely separate failure mode from style, so it's a
separate call rather than folded into the same prompt.

Call count is unchanged from the original design (draft + optional style fix
+ fact-check = up to 3 calls) - see feeds.yaml's max_write_per_run comment on
why that matters: this pipeline runs on a free-tier daily quota.
